<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/drop_i.png" style="margin-top: -0.5em; margin-bottom: -1em;" alt="I" /></span>n this
dastardly Age of the World, when Effeminacy and Debauchery have
taken Place of the Love of Glory, and that noble Ardor after warlike
Exploits, which flowed in the Bosoms of our Ancestors, genuine Heroism, or
rather an extraordinary Degree of Courage, are Prodigies among Men. What
Age, for Instance, produces a <i>Charles</i> of <i>Sweden</i>, a <i>Marlborough</i>, or a
Prince <i>Eugene</i>? These are <i>Rara Aves in Terris</i>, and when they appear,
they seem to be particularly designed by Heaven, for protecting the Rights
of injured Nations, against foreign Oppression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> securing the Privileges
of Innocence from the dire Assault of Prey and Rapine; and, in a Word,
vindicating the common Prerogatives of human Nature, from the fatal
Effects of brutal Rage, the love of Conquest, and an insatiable Lust after
Power. The amazing Benefit arising to Mankind from such illustrious and
exalted Characters, is, perhaps, the principal Reason why they attract the
Eyes, and command the Attention of all who hear of them, even in Quarters
of the World far remote from their Influence and Sphere of Action: Why
they are the Subjects of the Poets Song, the Founders of the Historian
Narration, and the Objects of the Painters Pencil; all which have a
Tendency to transmit their Names with immortal Glory to latest Ages, and
eternize their Memories, when their Bodies are mouldred into Dust, and
mingled with their Parent Earth. Perhaps their Rarity may also contribute,
in a great Measure, to that Esteem and Veneration, which the World thinks
fit to pay them: But sure if Heroism, Fortitude, and a Soul equal to all
the glorious Acts of War and Conquest, are Things so rare, and so much
admired among Men; how much rarer, and consequently how much more are they
to be admired among Women? In short, we may on this Occasion, without any
Hyperbole, use the Words of <i>Solomon</i>, and say, <i>One Man among a thousand
have I found, but among Women not so</i>. However, tho&#8217; Courage and warlike
Expeditions, are not the Provinces by the World allotted to Women since
the Days of the <i>Amazons</i>, yet the female Sex is far from being destitute
of Heroinism. <i>Cleopatra</i> headed a noble Army against <i>Mark Anthony</i>, the
greatest Warrior of his Time. <i>Semiramis</i> was not inferior to her in
Courage. The <i>Arcadian</i> Shepherdesses are as memorable for their Contempt
of Danger as their darling and beloved Swains. But among all our Heroines,
none comes more immediately under our Cognizance, nor, perhaps, more
merits our Attention than the remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> <i>Hannah Snell</i>, whose History is
highly interesting, both on Account of the Variety of amazing Incidents,
and the untainted Veracity with which it is attended. Some People guided
rather by the Suggestions of Caprice, than the Dictates of Reason and a
sound Understanding, have foolishly imagin&#8217;d, that Persons of low and
undistinguished Births, hardly ever rais&#8217;d themselves to the Summit of
Glory and Renown; but they will find themselves widely mistaken, when they
reflect on a <i>Kauli-Kan</i>, a <i>Cromwell</i>, and many others I could mention.
But if this Observation had the smallest Foundation either in Nature or
the Course of human Experience, from the most remote, to the present Age,
yet its Force does by no Means extend to <i>Hannah Snell</i>, the Heroine of
the subsequent Narrative: For though her immediate Progenitors were but
low in the World, when compared with Dukes, Earls and Generals, yet she
had the Seeds of Heroism, Courage and Patriotism transferr&#8217;d to her from
her Ancestors, as will appear from the following Account of her Genealogy.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Hannah Snell</span></span>, was born in <i>Fryer-Street</i>, in the Parish of <i>St. Hellen</i>&#8217;s,
in the City of <i>Worcester</i>, on the 23d Day of <i>April</i>, 1723. Her Parents,
tho&#8217; not immensely Rich by the hereditary Gifts of Fortune, yet secured a
Competency, which not only placed them above Contempt, but also enabled
them to bring up, and educate a numerous Family, none of whom have
miscarried for want either of sufficient Learning from Masters, or
salutary Advices and virtuous Examples from their Parents. And though Mrs.
<i>Hannah Snell</i> did not while she was at School learn to write, yet she
made a tolerable Progress in the other Part of Education common to her
Sex, and could read exceeding well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Though</span></span> the Father
of our Heroine was no more than a <i>Hosier</i> and <i>Dyer</i>,
yet he was the Son of the illustrious Capt. Lieut. <i>Sam. Snell</i>, for so I
may or rather must call him, since with Intrepidity he stood the Brunt of
the Wars in the latter End of King <i>William</i>&#8217;s Reign, signalized himself
at the taking of <i>Dunkirk</i> and served faithfully in the <i>English</i> Army
during Queen <i>Anne</i>&#8217;s Wars.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">This</span></span> Captain Lieutenant <i>Snell</i>, the Grandfather of our Heroine, enter&#8217;d
as a Volunteer in King <i>William</i>&#8217;s Reign, and in the Beginning of Queen
<i>Anne</i>&#8217;s Wars, was at the taking of <i>Dunkirk</i> under the Duke of
<i>Marlborough</i>, where the Captain Lieutenant was killed by a Shot fired
through the Wicket by the Governor; upon which he fired, and killed the
Governor. When the Duke was informed thereof, he called him, and asked him
what Preferment he desired; his Answer was, that he chose to accept of
that Commission, which was become vacant by the Death of the Captain
Lieutenant, which he was immediately preferr&#8217;d to, and took upon him the
Command as such. After the Surrender of <i>Dunkirk</i>, where he received
several dangerous Wounds, he returned to <i>England</i>, where he had the
proffer of a very handsome Pension in <i>Chelsea College</i>; but coveting
fresh Glory, and new Trophies of Conquest, he intreated of his Grace, that
he would permit him once more to go Abroad with him, that he might have an
Opportunity of signalizing his Valour, against the avowed Enemies of his
Country. This his Request his Grace complied with, and at the Battle of
<i>Malplaquet</i> he received a mortal Wound, from whence he was carried to
<i>Ghent</i>, where he died: This last, was the twenty-second bloody Battle in
which he had been engaged, and which he generously launched out into upon
the sublime Motives, Liberty and Property. This Gentleman&#8217;s Character must
appear the more sublime, when we observe how he advanced himself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> Merit
from a private <i>Cadit</i> to the Rank he held at his Death; and had it not
been for his over-modest and generous Sentiments, he might have been
preferr&#8217;d to a much higher Rank; but the <i>Englishman</i> prevail&#8217;d above
Self-Interest.</p>

<p>The Son of this illustrious Man of whom we have here treated, and Father
of our Heroine, was possessed of many excellent Gifts, particularly
Courage, for which he was distinguished; yet never had an Opportunity of
displaying his Bravery in the Field of Battle, his Genius leading him
another Way, to wit, Trade, into which he entered very young, and
prospered in the World, married to his liking, and in a few Years saw
himself the Father of nine promising Children, three of which were Sons,
and six Daughters, all of whom save one Daughter, were either Soldiers or
Sailors, or intermarried with them. The eldest of the Sons, <i>Samuel
Snell</i>, incapable of Restraint, and void of all Fear, listed himself a
Soldier in Lord <i>Robert Manners</i>&#8217;s Company in the first Regiment of
Foot-Guards, commanded by his Royal Highness the Duke of <i>Cumberland</i>;
when he was draughted to go for <i>Flanders</i>, where he received his mortal
Wound at the battle of <i>Fontenoy</i>; and being sent to the Hospital at
<i>Doway</i>, he there expired.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Tho&#8217;</span></span> the Daughters were, by those who knew them, accounted aimable Women,
both on Account of their Persons and their Virtue; yet I shall pass over
the Characters of five of them in Silence, and only take Notice of that of
<i>Hannah</i>, the youngest of them but one, who is the Heroine of this
Subject. It is a common Thing to observe a Family dispersed, when the
Heads of that Family are either laid in their Graves, or by accidental
Calamities rendered incapable of supporting it longer. Accordingly, when
the Father and Mother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> <i>Hannah</i> died, <i>Hannah</i> came up to <i>London</i>, and
arrived in Town on <i>Christmas-Day</i>, 1740, and resided for some Time, with
her Sister in <i>Wapping</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Some</span></span> Time after she came to <i>London</i>, she contracted an Acquaintance with
one <i>James Summs</i>, a Sailor, who was a <i>Dutchman</i>; this Acquaintance was
gradually improved into a Familiarity, and this Familiarity soon created a
mutual, tho&#8217; not a criminal Passion; for in a little Time, <i>Summs</i> made
his Addresses to her as a Lover, and gained her Consent, and was married
to her at the <i>Fleet</i>, on the sixth Day of <i>January</i>, 1743-4. But all his
Promises of Friendship, proved Instances of the highest Perfidy, and he
turn&#8217;d out the worst and most unnatural of Husbands. Since, tho&#8217; she had
Charms enough to captivate the Heart, and secure the Affection of any
reasonable Man, yet she was despised and contemned by her Husband, who not
only kept criminal Company with other Women of the basest Characters, but
also made away with her Things, in Order to support his Luxury, and the
daily Expences of his Whores. During this unlucky Period of the Husband&#8217;s
Debauchery, she poor Woman proved with Child, and at the same Time felt
all the Shocks of Poverty, without exposing her Necessities to her nearest
Friends. But at last, her Pregnancy laid the Foundation for her passing
through all the Scenes, thro&#8217; which she has wandered; for when she was
seven Months gone with Child, her perfidious Husband finding himself
deeply involv&#8217;d in Debt, made an Elopement from her. Notwithstanding these
her Calamities, she patiently bore herself up under them, and in two
Months after her Husband&#8217;s Departure was delivered of a Daughter which
lived no more than seven Months, and was decently interred at her own
Expence at <i>St. George</i>&#8217;s Parish in <i>Middlesex</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">From</span></span> the Time
of her Husband&#8217;s Elopement till the Time she put on Man&#8217;s
Cloaths, she continued with her Sister, who is married to one <i>James
Gray</i>, a House Carpenter, in <i>Ship-street, Wapping</i>, and from whence she
took her Departure unknown to any, and was never heard of until her
Return; and with whom she now dwells.</p>

<p>As she was now free from all the Ties arising from Nature and
Consanguinity; she thought herself privileged to roam in quest of the Man,
who, without Reason, had injured her so much; for there are no Bounds to
be set either to Love, Jealousy or Hatred, in the female Mind. That she
might execute her Designs with the better Grace, and the more Success, she
boldly commenced a Man, at least in her Dress, and no doubt she had a
Right to do so, since she had the real Soul of a Man in her Breast.
Dismay&#8217;d at no Accidents, and giving a full Scope to the genuine Bent of
her Heart, she put on a Suit of her Brother-in-Law, Mr. <i>James Gray</i>&#8217;s,
Cloaths, assumed his Name, and set out on the 23d of <i>November</i>, 1745, and
travelled to <i>Coventry</i>, with a View of finding her Husband, where she
enlisted on the 27th of the said Month of <i>November</i>, in General <i>Guise</i>&#8217;s
Regiment, and in the Company belonging to Captain <i>Miller</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">With</span></span> this Regiment she marched from <i>Coventry</i> to <i>Carlisle</i>, where she
learned her military Exercise, which she now performs with as much Skill
and Dexterity as any Serjeant or Corporal in his Majesty&#8217;s Service. But
here, as Fortune is often a Foe to the Distressed, she met with a
discouraging Circumstance; for her Serjeant, whose Name was <i>Davis</i>,
having a criminal Inclination for a young Woman in that Town, looked upon
this our Female Heroine, (a common Soldier in the Company) as a proper
Person for assisting him in this his vicious Intrigue, therefore disclosed
to her this Bosom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Secret, and desired her Endeavours in promoting this
End; however, this open Discovery caused a sudden Emotion in her Mind, her
virtuous Soul abhorred with a becoming Detestation the criminal Intention;
yet to prevent the ill Consequences that she foresaw must ensue from a
refusal of complying with his Request, she promised to use her Endeavours
in his Behalf; but instead of acting the Pimp, she went and disclosed the
whole Matter to the young Woman, and warned her against the impending
Danger; which Act of Virtue and Generosity in a Soldier, gained her the
Esteem and Confidence of this young Woman, who took great delight in her
Company; and seldom a Day passed but they were together, having cultivated
an Intimacy and Friendship with each other: But <i>Davis</i> going one Day to
make his Addresses to his Mistress, met with an unexpected Repulse, which
unusual Treatment made him suspect our Female Soldier. Jealousy that
Moment took Possession of his guilty Breast, and he imagined, that instead
of befriending him in his Amours, she had become his Rival, and had gained
her over to her Inclinations. These Reflections troubled him much; Revenge
reigned triumphant in his Breast, and how to punish her was his chief Aim:
He took hold of the earliest Opportunity, and accused her before the
commanding Officer for Neglect of Duty, upon which she was sentenced to
receive six hundred Lashes, five hundred of which she received, having her
Hands tied to the Castle Gates for a Crime which Nature put it out of her
Power to perpetrate, and had undergone the Punishment of the other
Hundred, had it not been for the Intercession of some of the Officers.
This severe and unjust Punishment, reduced her to a very low State, but
notwithstanding this severe Whipping, the Villain <i>Davis</i> bore her an
implacable Hatred, and strove all he could to depress her, by putting her
upon the hardest and most difficult Duties; but she was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> tenderly and
affectionately regarded by her Female Friend, who neglected nothing that
might assure her, she was neither unmindful nor ungrateful for the
Friendship she had shewed her. Soon after this, a fresh and unforeseen
Trouble presented itself; there happened to come a fresh Recruit to the
Regiment, a young Man whose Name was <i>George Beck</i>, a Carpenter, born in
<i>Worcester</i> City, that had come to <i>London</i> in Quest of Business, and
happened to lodge with her Brother and Sister, and whom she left at her
Brothers House when she went off in Men&#8217;s Cloaths, the Sight of whom
troubled her much, fearing she should be discovered by him; this, together
with the Serjeant&#8217;s ill Treatment, inspired her with a Resolution to
desert; having carried this her Intention to Maturity, she communicated
the same to her intimate Friend the young Woman, who, tho&#8217; loth to lose
the Company of such a Friend and Companion, yielded to her Remonstrances,
and provided her with Money to bear her Charge in her intended Flight.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Having</span></span> gone so far with the Author of this Subject, I cannot refrain
making a little Digression, and making a few Reflections upon the
melancholy Prospect: What an Ocean of Troubles was this unfortunate Woman
involved in? Behold her inwardly looking back on the past Vicissitudes of
her Life, on an inhumane, ungrateful and faithless Husband, who had broke
through all Engagements, sacred and civil, and had drove her into all the
direful Troubles and Afflictions she was then involved in: Behold her
tempted by a vicious Man, to be aiding and assisting in carrying on an
immodest and abominable Intrigue; but (being inspired with virtuous and
generous Sentiments) she proved the Instrument of extracting Good out of
Evil, in discovering to the innocent Maid, where the Net was spread for
her, that she might guard her self against the Adversary: Behold the
Friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> that this virtuous Discovery produced, it chained them
together in the strictest Bonds of Love and Affection, which never quitted
its hold, till forced thereto by a hard Fate: Behold her suspected of
supplanting the Serjeant of his Mistress, and the direful Effects his
Jealousy occasioned, having her Arms extended, and fixed to the City
Gates, and there receive the Number of five hundred severe Lashes, as the
Effects of a partial and unjust Sentence: Behold her tender Flesh cut and
mangled by these Scourgings, and the Pains and Agonies she suffered:
Behold in this her Distress, the friendly Sympathy and eager Assistance of
her female Friend, who administred Relief to her under this her Dilemma:
Behold the Commotions she felt upon perciving one in the Regiment whom she
knew, and by whom she was afraid of being discovered; the bad Treatment
she met with from the Serjeant, and what a Storm must surround her upon
her projecting the Means for an Escape, and the moving Seperation &#8217;twixt
her and her Friend: The Rehearsal of so many concurring Circumstances of
Adversity, is sufficient to melt the most stoney Heart into a
compassionate Tenderness for this our female Adventurer.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Having</span></span> finished this Digression, I shall begin where I left off. Upon her
Desertion, she set out on Foot for <i>Portsmouth</i>, and about a Mile out of
<i>Carlisle</i>, exchanges her regimental Clothes for worse, with some People
employed in cutting down Pease. But Courage and Love, like impetuous
Torrents, rage the more they are opposed; for <i>Hannah</i> whose Breast was
actuated with both these Principles, had no sooner arrived at
<i>Portsmouth</i>, than she found her Expectations disapointed: However,
whether Despair or the Hopes of again meeting that unfaithful Man, who had
made her the Mother of a helpless Infant, actuated her Breast and gave her
Passions a preternatural Spring. So it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> was, that she courageously
inlisted herself in Captain <i>Graham</i>&#8217;s Company in Colonel <i>Fraser</i>&#8217;s
Regiment, and soon after there was a Draught made, to go abroad in Admiral
<i>Boscawen</i>&#8217;s Fleet, and she chanced to be one of the Number draughted, and
went immediately on board the <i>Swallow</i> Sloop, Captain <i>Rosier</i>,
Commander; and when on board was observed to be handy in washing, as well
as in dressing Victuals, for the Mess she first belonged to, and being
thus remarkable, she was sollicited by <i>Richard Wyegate</i>, Lieutenant of
Marines, to become one of their Mess, which she readily agreed to, as
believing the Officers Mess, was better than the common Mens, and she
acted in the Station of their Boy, and by her modest Deportment soon
became a Favourite, drest their Victuals, washed and mended their Linnen.
She was stationed (in Case of an Engagement) on the Quarter-Deck, and to
fight at small Arms, and made one of the After-Guard; she was obliged to
keep watch four Hours on and four off, Day and Night, being often obliged
to go aloft, and altho&#8217; unexperienced with these Kind of Hardships, soon
became expert in the Business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> their first setting sail, they enjoyed as fine Weather, and as fair
Winds as could possibly be wished for, to convey a Ship safely and
expeditiously from one Harbour to another. But no sooner were they arrived
in the Bay of <i>Biscay</i> than the Scene was altered; their favourable
Weather converted into a dismal Hurricane, and their smooth placed Ocean,
changed into Billows, which threaten&#8217;d them with immediate Death, by this
Moment raising them to the Clouds, and in the next plunging them, as it
were, to the Centre of the Earth. The Danger may be easily estimated, from
the Circumstance, for the <i>Swallow</i> was as strong and well built a Vessel,
as any belonging to his Majesty&#8217;s Navy of her Burden: yet such was the
Stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> of Weather, that she sprung her Main-mast, and lost not only the
Gib-Boom, but also two Top-masts. After they had for several Days been
beat about in this imminent Danger, they with great Difficulty arrived in
the Port of <i>Lisbon</i>, which was great Joy to them, after having suffered
so much in the Bay of <i>Biscay</i>, where every Moment they had been in danger
of being swallowed up in the vast Abyss. In this Port, which to them was
like a safe Asylum, or Sanctuary, to a Man pursued by a hungry and enraged
Lyon, they continued three Weeks; because the Vessel was so damaged, that
the Number of Hands employed in refitting her could not do it sooner.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Here</span></span> they found the <i>Vigilant</i> Man of War, which was likewise much damaged
in the Storm in the Bay of <i>Biscay</i>, being one of the Fleet that sail&#8217;d
from <i>Portsmouth</i> with them.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">While</span></span> she was ashore at <i>Lisbon</i>, with her Master, she was quartered at
one Mrs. <i>Poore</i>&#8217;s a Punch-House and Tavern; but says nothing material
happened there, during the three Weeks.</p>

<p>As it often happens for the wise and noble Purposes of Heaven, that one
Misfortune succeeds another, as close as the Waves on the Sea-shore; so
the <i>Swallow</i> set sail in Company with the <i>Vigilant</i> Man of War, in Order
to join the Admiral&#8217;s Squadron; and the next Night after their Departure,
another violent Storm happened, in which the <i>Swallow</i> not only lost sight
of the <i>Vigilant</i>, but also sprung her Main-mast, lost most of her
Rigging, and was so much damaged in her Hold, that all the Sailors and
Marines were obliged to take their several Turns at the Pump, which is by
far a harder Piece of Labour, than those who have never tried it are apt
to imagine. Such a Series of Calamities succeeding each other so fast, and
so <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>unexpectedly, were, in all Appearance, sufficient to daunt the
strongest Resolution, and cool the Courage of the bravest young Sailor
that ever trod the Deck of a Ship. But some Minds are cast, if I may so
speak, in so happy a Mould, that Danger and Difficulties instead of
depressing, raise them above themselves, enlarge their Views, and animate
them to stem the Tide of Adversity, which they rarely fail to surmount by
Steadiness and Perseverance. To this favourite Class of Mortals our
Heroine belonged, since on this Occasion she not only willingly took her
Turn at the Pump of a sinking Vessel, but also performed the several
Offices of a common Sailor, and in both Qualities behaved with such
Judgment and Intrepidity, that, next under God, she was looked upon by the
Ship&#8217;s Company as a Kind of Deliverer, and an Instrument of their
Preservation. The <i>Swallow</i> after this Disaster made the best of her Way
to <i>Gibraltar</i>, were as soon as they arrived, she went on Shore, and
attended Lieutenant <i>Richard Wigate</i>, Lieutenant of the Marines, who was
very ill, and lodged at Mrs. <i>Davis</i>&#8217;s on the Hill.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> Ship refitted here with the utmost Expedition, and sailed for the
<i>Madiera</i> Islands, where she took in such Wines, and other Provisions, as
was thought necessary for the intended Voyage. As Providence is always
Kind to Distress, she here met with the <i>Sheerness</i> Privateer of
<i>Bristol</i>, whose Commander generously supplied her with a sufficient
Number of Hands, and from thence, they sailed to the Cape of <i>Good Hope</i>,
and in their Voyage, were put upon Short, and some time after upon Half
Allowance.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">During</span></span> their Passage, their Allowance was shortened, as I just
beforementioned, and that which they had, was salt and bad, and besides
there was so great a Scarcity of Water on board, that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> allowed
only a Pint a Day for some Time; all which, must have been great Hardships
to her.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">When</span></span> they arrived at the Cape, they there met with the Admiral in the
<i>Namur</i>, which was great Joy to them; and our Heroine being disappointed
hitherto of meeting her faithless Husband, and now seeing the Fleet all in
Company, was in hopes of acquiring some Glory as a Soldier, knowing the
Reason of this Fleet&#8217;s being fitted out was to annoy the Enemies of her
Country, which soon happened according to her Wishes, as the Fleet soon
sailed from this Port for <i>Morusus</i>, on which Place they began their first
Attack; and though unexperienced in the Use of Arms, except in learning
her Exercise, she behaved with an uncommon Bravery, and exerted herself in
her Country&#8217;s Cause.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">This</span></span> Attack did not hold long; our brave Admiral finding this
impracticable, and unwilling to lose his Ships and Men, for whom he had
great Regard, left that Place, and sailed for Fort St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s, where
they arrived in a little Time, and the Marines being put on Shore joined
the <i>English</i> Army, and encamped, and in about three Weeks marched and
encamped before <i>Elacapong</i>, and laid Siege to it, with an Intent to storm
the Place. This fresh Adventure inspired her with fresh Hopes of shewing
her undaunted Courage, which she did to the Admiration of her Officers;
but on the tenth Day of the Siege, a Shell from the <i>English</i> took the
Magazine of the Enemy, and blew it up, which occasioned them to surrender
at Discretion.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I cannot</span></span> help reflecting a little upon the Hardships, Fatigues and Dangers
she incountered from the Time she left <i>Lisbon</i> in <i>Europe</i>, till her
Arrival before <i>Pondicherry</i> in <i>Asia</i>, so many Vicissitudes, as were
sufficient to damp the Spirits of an <i>Alexander</i> or a <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, Storms,
Hurricanes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> pinching Want, were her Concomitants, pumping an almost
wrecked Vessel, was her most constant (tho&#8217; laborious) Employment;
seventeen Weeks short Allowance from the <i>Maderas</i> to the <i>Cape</i> of <i>Good
Hope</i>, was all she had to subsist upon; Attacks upon fortified Towns, some
of which were impregnable, where Bomb-Shells and Cannons were incessantly
displaying Death wherever they fell; at other Times, moving, marching, and
encamping; I say such Reflections and gloomy Prospects, prove the Cause of
many such Hardships and Difficulties even in the most robust of the
Masculine Gender, how much more in one of the tender Sex, who are afraid
of Shaddows, and shudders at the Pressage of a Dream.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I shall</span></span> now proceed to their March to <i>Pondicherry</i>, which is but a few
Leagues from the forementioned Place; they encamped within about three
Miles from the Town, <i>Boscawen</i> being then both Admiral and General, and
Major <i>Mount Pleasant</i> informed them with their Intention, which was to
storm the Place, which Attack was began by the Ships firing at the Fort,
some of which Time they lay Middle-deep in Water in their Trenches: This
Attack continued eleven Weeks, part of which Time they had no Bread, most
of their Food being Rice; and the many Bombs and Shells thrown among them,
killed and wounded many of their Men. During this Space of Time, she
behaved with the greatest Bravery and Intrepidity, such as was consistent
with the Character of an <i>English</i> Soldier, and though so deep in Water,
fired 37 Rounds of Shot, and received a Shot in the Groin, six Shots in
one Leg, and five in the other.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> Siege being now broke up, by reason of the heavy Rains, and violent
Claps of Thunder, it being the Time of the Year when the <i>Monzoons</i> (for
so they are called in that Country) happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> she was sent to an Hospital
at <i>Cuddylorom</i>, under the Care of two able Physicians, <i>viz.</i> Mr.
<i>Belchier</i> and Mr. <i>Hancock</i>; but she, not willing to be discovered,
extracted the Ball out of her Groin herself, and always drest that Wound;
and in about three Months was perfectly cured; but most of the Fleet being
sailed before her Recovery, she was left behind, and sent on board the
<i>Tartar Pink</i>, which then lay in the Harbour, where she remained, doing
the Duty of a Sailor, till the Return of the Fleet from <i>Madrass</i> when she
was turned over to the <i>Eltham</i>, Captain <i>Lloyd</i> Commander, and sailed for
<i>Bombay</i>, where they arrived in about ten Days, being scarce of Hands,
having only eight in a Watch, of which she was one; and what made their
Fatigue still more, was their being obliged to keep continually at the
Pump, the Ship having sprung a Leak in her Larboard Bow.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">At</span></span> <i>Bombay</i> they were obliged to heave the Ship down in Order to clean her
Bottom, which kept them there about five Weeks, and then they sailed to
<i>Monserrat</i>, to take the <i>Royal Duke Indiaman</i> under Convoy, to bring her
to Fort St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s where she was gone for Provisions.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">At</span></span> <i>Bombay</i> her Master being on Shore, she was obliged to watch in her
turn, as is usual on such Occasions; but being one Night on Duty, Mr.
<i>Allen</i>, who then had the Command of the Ship, being on Shore, desired her
to sing for him, which she begged that he would excuse, as she was not
very well; but he being proud in this his new Employ, as Commander,
absolutely commanded her to sing; which she refused to do, as she did not
think it any incumbent Duty for a Soldier to sing when commanded so to do,
and that by one who was not an Officer in their Core, or had she any
Obligations to him; however this Refusal proved of fatal Consequence to
her; he ordered her immediately into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> Irons, which accordingly was done,
and continued for the Space of five Days, and then ordered her to have a
dozen Lashes, which she had at the Gang-Way of the Ship, and after that
sent to the Foretop-mast-head, for four Hours; such is the Cruelty of
those that are invested with Power, and do not know how to use it.
However, this Man&#8217;s Cruelty did not go unpunished; for after there Arival
in <i>England</i>, as they were unriging the Ship, one of the Sailors let a
Block fall on his Head, which hurt him greatly.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">They</span></span> now, with the <i>Royal Duke</i>, sailed from <i>Montserrat</i> to Fort St.
<i>David</i>&#8217;s, and was there at the Time of the great Hurricane, when the
<i>Namur</i> and <i>Pembroke</i>, and other Ships were lost: The <i>Eltham</i>, of which
she was on board, had some Share in the said Hurricane, for she broke her
Cables, and was forced to Sea; but happily returned in again to the Port
without receiving any great Damage.</p>

<p>Now during her stay here at Fort St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s, she had frequent
Opportunities, and Causes for Reflection: She went on Shore sundry Times
along with some of the Men, where her Ears and her Eyes were often
affected with the disagreeable Sound of horrible Oaths, and many lewd
Actions and Gestures, such as stripping themselves naked, when they went
to swim, a Sight, which however disagreeable it might appear to her, yet
she was forced to make a Virtue of Necessity, by openly conforming herself
to those rude, indiscreet, and unwomanly Actions, which she silently
disfavoured and contemned. But here the unpolished Tars had not
Opportunities of extending their Wickedness to such a high Pitch as they
would have done, had they had Objects to satiate their brutish Appetites;
for there were but a few white Women in the Place; however she saw too
much not to be afflicted, lest her Sex should by their impudent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>unlimited Behaviour, be discovered, and her Virtue sacrificed to their
rapacious, boundless and lustful Appetites; but Innocency and Virtue is
the safest Protection in the worst of Times; and this was what sheltered
her from the much dreaded Calamity that threatned her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 19th of <i>November</i> last, the <i>Eltham</i> sailed with the rest of the
Fleet from Fort St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s, and kept Company till they came to the Cape
of <i>Good Hope</i>; when the <i>Eltham</i> had Orders to make the best of her Way
to <i>Lisbon</i>, to take in Money for the Use of the Merchants of <i>London</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> Day after they left Fort St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s, her Master Lieutenant
<i>Wyegate</i> died, in whose Death she lost the only Friend she had on board,
and where to find such another, she knew not: This brought afresh into her
Mind the Remembrance of her faithless Husband, whole Villainy and Cruelty
had drove her to all the Straits, Hardships and Dangers she endured both
by Sea and Land, and had reduced her to the wretched State she was then
in. These Reflections were sufficient to have sunk the Spirits of the most
hardy Hero; but she bore them with a becoming Resignation. She was
distinguished amongst the Ship&#8217;s Crew for her Ingenuity in washing and
mending of Linnen, but as it is common on board of King&#8217;s Ships to have
some Men who are dexterous at such Performances, she was not suspected
upon that Score.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Some</span></span> Time after the Death of Lieutenant <i>Wyegate</i>, she was taken into the
Service of Lieutenant <i>Kite</i>, second Lieutenant of the Ship, and continued
so about two Months; when he getting a Boy, he recommended her to Mr.
<i>Wallace</i>, third Lieutenant of the Ship, who proved also a very good
Master to her. But now she was laid open (though contrary to her
Inclination) to the Company of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> Sailors, for they were used, when she
had her Head shaved, to enquire why she did not shave her Beard; her
Answer was, that she was too young. Upon which they used to damn her,
calling her Miss <i>Molly Gray</i>, she used to return the uncivil Compliment,
by damning them, and telling them, that she could prove herself, as she
had always done, during the Voyage, as good a Man as any Seaman on board,
and that she would lay them a Wager upon that Point.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">During</span></span> this long Voyage, they often used, as I have just said, on account
of her smooth Face, to burlesque her, by swearing she was a Woman. This
Expression, however indifferently they meant it, gave her abundance of
Trouble; she foresaw what the Consequence would be, in case this Joke was
carried too far; to prevent which, she with a masculine but modest
Assurance, told them, that if they would lay any Wager, she would give
them ocular Demonstration of her being as much a Man as the best in the
Ship; which Reply had the desired Effect, seeing it put a Stop to their
further Suggestions: Next, they began to declare her to be a Woman on
account of her smooth Face, seeing she had no Beard; but she told them
that she was so very young, that it could not be supposed she should have
a Beard so soon; however, she could not prevent their calling her by the
Name of <i>Molly Gray</i>, which Appellation she went by during the Voyage,
until they arrived at <i>Lisbon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">While</span></span> they lay at <i>Lisbon</i>, she often went on Shore in Company with the
Ships Crew, upon Parties of Pleasure, and was always their Companion in
their Revellings; this Part she acted, not out of Choice, but for wise
Ends. She remember&#8217;d in what Manner she had been reflected upon by them
during the Voyage from St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s to <i>Lisbon</i>, therefore she pointed
out this Method as the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> effectual, to prevent any further suspicious
<i>Reflections for the future</i>. She very wisely judged, that by associating
herself with them, by shewing a free and chearful Disposition, and by
being ready to come into their Measures, she should banish from their
Imaginations the least Suspicion of her being a Woman, and by that Means
enjoy a free and uninterrupted Passage to her native Country, without
discovering her Sex. There was one of the Ship&#8217;s Crew, named <i>Edward
Jefferies</i>, an intimate Acquaintance, a Marine, and Mess-mate of her&#8217;s;
they two had contracted an Acquaintance and Familiarity with two young
Women in <i>Lisbon</i>, the handsomest of which was the favourite of our
Heroine; but <i>Jefferies</i> taking a greater liking to her Choice than his
own, proposed to toss up who should have her, which she readily agreed to,
not caring how soon she should be rid of such a Companion: This
<i>Jefferies</i> on tossing up gained the Lady, upon which she readily resigned
her into his Hands, and made that serve as a good Excuse for being rid of
them both. This Intimacy subsisted between them and the <i>Portugueze</i> Women
while they remained at <i>Lisbon</i>, and when they were about to set sail for
<i>England</i>, their Sweethearts came to the Ship&#8217;s side in order to take
Leave of them, but was prevented from coming on board, by the Command of
the Captain.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">We</span></span> shall leave the candid Reader at liberty to judge the Disorders,
Terrors and Distractions that so many various Scenes must have plunged her
into; such a Disquiet, that she had not felt the like in all her past
Enterprizes. A thousand Inquietudes rolled in upon her, like so many
Billows, and almost sunk her down into the Abyss of Despair. She began to
reflect upon the many Vicissitudes she had underwent, since her first
launching out into the boisterous Sea of War, occasioned by the Cruelty of
a perfidious Husband. What Dangers, what <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Hardships, and what Fatigues she
had underwent! The many Inconveniences she had overcome, and the
Difficulties she had surmounted, in preserving her Virtue untainted in the
midst of so many vicious and prophane Actions, as had often been
represented in their blackest Sable to her view, and that she had hitherto
come off Conqueress, and when almost at the Door of her native Country,
unsullied and undefiled by any of these Temptations wherewith she had been
assaulted; then to be in the greatest Danger; then to have that Virtue,
which had hitherto been her assistant and comfortable Companion in all her
adverse Fortune, tore from her Breast, and nothing left behind but Shame,
Guilt and Confusion. These Reflections had almost vanquished her great
Spirit, had not her good Genius led her to put in Practice the Scheme she
had formed at <i>Lisbon</i>, which answered the End she aimed at, and by which
her Virtue, which was always dear to her, remains still untainted, to her
immortal Praise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Affair of the Supply of the Men they had from the <i>Sheerness</i>
Privateer at <i>Madeira</i>, she gave the following Account; which was, that
after they were come on board the <i>Swallow</i> Sloop, some of them seemed
very pensive; so that her Curiosity led her to enquire into the Reason of
their Grief, which she found was occasioned by their being brought on
board a Man of War, which at first to her seemed strange, not being
acquainted with the Manner of Men being impressed; and having often
conversed with some of them, found they were sent on board by Force; and
some of them having Wives and Children in <i>England</i>, and some in
<i>Ireland</i>, the Thoughts of their long Separation from their Wives and
Families, and the uncertainty of ever seeing them again, was the chief
Cause of their Sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">This</span></span> Relation,
and the Anxieties some of them shewed, gave her new Matter
of Contemplation, and often, when retired in her Master&#8217;s Cabin, reflected
on her own Fate, having herself been married to a most faithless Man, who
had left her in the utmost Distress, at a Time she was not able to help
herself, and that without any Reason, but what was occasioned by his own
Extravagances. But here she found the Difference in that Sex, and that
greater then she ever conceived before: Here she saw Men in the greatest
Affliction, for being forced from them they loved; offering there all for
Liberty to return to their native Land and Families, whilst her perfideous
Husband&#8217;s chief Care was to avoid her. However, it was some Consolation to
her, in these her distressed Circumstances, to find some on board, and who
she concluded must be her Companions as Shipmates, inspired with
Sentiments of Honour and Virtue; she also reflected on the unhappy
Circumstances of those poor Women and Children these Men had left behind,
and often wished she could have an Opportunity of relating to them what
she now saw; imagining from her own Case, that it would be some
Consolation to them to hear so great Proof of their Affections. She at
first blamed them for going to Sea on board the Privateer, but when she
was informed that it was only for a little Time, and they not bound to
serve longer, than a certain Time specified in their Articles, and that
their chief Motives was to serve their Families; in so doing she looked on
them as real Objects of Compassion, which occasioned her to sympathize
with them; and though Fortune had been so unkind to herself, she could not
refrain thinking of theirs, and often endeavoured to asswage their
Sorrows, by recommending to them Hopes of a happy Return to <i>England</i>; and
also procured every Thing which she thought necessary for them on board,
which was somewhat in her Power, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> Recourse to all her Master&#8217;s
Stores, especially his Liquors, which was pretty plentiful at that Time.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I shall</span></span> depart a little from the Subject, and give the Reader an Account
of that basest of Men, our Heroine&#8217;s Husband, who upon deserting his
lawful Wife, entered himself as a Foremast Man on board one of his
Countrymen, then lying in the River <i>Thames</i>. But where can the guilty
Criminal fly for Sanctuary? His own Conscience must prove his Executioner,
and a thousand Monitors within, who Vulture like, always gnaw the Liver,
not suffering the Mind to enjoy the shortest Interval of Quiet; this
admirable Truth has been fully verified in him, according to the most
substantial Circumstances, as shall hereafter be made appear.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">One</span></span> Day at <i>Lisbon</i>, on her Return to <i>England</i>, falling in Company with
many of her Ship-mates, they all went into an <i>Irish</i> House, by the
<i>Romanado</i>&#8217;s, to drink some Wine, where was sitting at the same Time an
<i>Englishman</i>, a Sailor, who had lately come from <i>Genoa</i> on board a
<i>Dutch</i> Vessel; there were some of his Brother Tars in Company who knew
him; upon which they became very merry, and began, over their Glass and
their Pipe, to talk over some of their Adventures, and what they met with
in their Travels worthy taking Notice of; and she, acoording to her
constant Practice, was enquiring amongst the Mariners if any of them knew
one <i>James Summs</i>, who, she said, had formerly been an intimate
Acquaintance of her&#8217;s; upon which this Stranger broke Speech, and told &#8217;em
of an Affair that happened at <i>Genoa</i> while he was there. There was, says
he, a <i>Dutchman</i> of that Name, a Sailor, imprisoned there, for stabbing a
Native of the Place, a Person of some Distinction, with a Knife, of which
Wound he soon expired; I, with two or three more of our Countrymen
appointed to go and visit him under this his Misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> which we
accordingly did: When we came to the Place, we were introduced by a Kind
of Officer, where he lay in a melancholy Situation; but upon our entering
the Room, he raised himself up from the Place where he had reclined his
Head, and saluted us in <i>English</i>; then we began to condole his
Misfortune: Upon which, finding us affected with his melancholy Situation,
and the cruel Punishment he was about to suffer, he spoke to us in the
following Manner. Gentlemen, The Crime I am to die for I committed,
therefore my Punishment will be just whenever it falls: But this is not
the only Crime I stand indicted for at the Bar of that All-seeing Judge,
who searches into the innermost Recesses of our most concealed Actions,
and who pursues the Guilty where-ever they go; I, who am here condemned
for Murder, a few Years ago lived in <i>Wapping, London</i>, my Name is <i>James
Summs</i>, a <i>Dutchman</i> by Birth; I married a young Woman there, named
<i>Hannah Snell</i>, born in <i>Worcester</i>, but who then lodged with a
Brother-in-Law, a Carpenter in <i>Ship-street</i>: We had not been long joined
in Matrimony before she proved with Child; and I, forgetting my Duty as a
Husband, and an approaching Father, gave a loose to my vicious
Inclinations, eloped from the Partner of my Bed, and the one half of
myself, went and took up my Residence amongst a Parcel of lewd, base
Women, who withdrew my Affections entirely from her, who had the only just
Title to it; and to satisfy their insatiable and extravagant Demands, I
drained her of her all. This proved only the Downfall to my future
Calamities; for my Substance being now exhausted, thrust out of Doors by
these <i>Ladies of Pleasure</i>, who proved to me <i>Ladies of Pain</i>, and being
ashamed to look my much injured Wife in the Face any more, whom I had so
basely betrayed, my Mind was rack&#8217;d with exquisite Torture, so that I
would willingly have fled from myself if it had been possible. A thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Inventions came into my Head how I should dispose of myself at this
critical Juncture. I employed all the Skill I was master of to be
assisting in extricating me out of this Dilemma; at last I resolved to go
on board one Ship or other, in order to make a Voyage.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> first Ship I boarded was a <i>Rotterdam</i> Trader, who accepted me in the
Capacity of a Sailor, having but few Hands, the Steersman agreed to give
me 40 Guilders <i>per</i> Month. A few Days afterwards we made down with the
Tide, and sailed over to <i>Rotterdam</i>, where we unloaded: We had not been
many Days here, before an unforeseen Accident happened, which was like to
have produced fatal Consequences: One of the Boys going one Day into the
Steerage with a lighted Candle, where was some Powder loose; a Spark from
the Candle dropt into the Powder, which in an Instant blew up, and did
great Damage to the Vessel. This Accident was charged upon me by two of
the Men who bore me a Grudge; upon which I was Keel-haul&#8217;d, and received
many Lashes besides. This ill Usage provoked me much, so that I determined
to quit my Master&#8217;s Service, and let him know that I intended to leave
him; upon which he paid me my Wages, and we parted. I then entered myself
on board an <i>Irish</i> Merchant, bound to <i>Lisbon</i>, which Voyage I performed,
and returned to <i>Cork</i>, the Place where the Cargo was to be disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Here</span></span>, after I had received my Wages, I was discharged, and falling into
bad Company, my Wages was soon spent, and being without Money, Cloaths or
Friends, in a strange Country, made my Case very deplorable, which brought
into my Mind, my wicked Proceedings to my dear Wife, and I lookt upon
those Afflictions I underwent, as a just Punishment from Heaven, for my
wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Actions; however, these Reflections soon gave Way to
Self-preservation; I was in great Distress, and how to work my
Deliverance, was the main Subject of my Thoughts; at the very same Time,
there was a <i>Portuguese</i> Vessel lying in the Harbour, bound to <i>Genoa</i>;
they wanted a few Hands, some of their own Men having died in the Voyage;
I proffered my Service; they accepted of me, staid in <i>Cork</i>, a few Days
afterwards, then weighed Anchor, and set sail for <i>Genoa</i>, where we
arrived in Safety in about three Weeks; here we had not continued long,
before I perpetrated the Murther, for which I am about to suffer: Now
Gentlemen, I have given you a full Account of the most material Incidents
that has happened to me since I left <i>England</i>, I therefore earnestly
intreat the Favour of you, when once you return to <i>England</i>, to enquire
after my Wife, and if you find her, be pleased in my Name, to present her
the Love of a dying Husband, who conscious of his Guilt, humbly begs her
Pardon and Forgiveness, for all the Injuries he hath done her, since first
he knew her; this his Request we promised to fulfill, if once we returned
to <i>England</i>; so we took our last Farewel. None of us, ever saw him
afterwards, but were informed, that he was sewed up in a Sack, with heavy
Stones, and thrown into the Sea; the other two <i>Englishmen</i> sailed for
<i>Leghorn</i>, and I for this Place, and when I go Home, I intend to make an
Enquiry concerning the said Woman: She listened attentively all the While
he was relating this Story, and weighing all the particular Circumstances
of this Relation, she perceived so many concurring Circumstances blended
together, as put it beyond all Doubt he was her Husband; this Account
however, notwithstanding his vile Proceedings, grieved her much, and no
doubt would have broke forth into briny Tears, had she been in a Place of
Retirement: She sometimes grieved at his cruel and untimely Fate, but
suddenly, the ill Treatment she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> met with from him, returned triumphant in
her Mind, and extinguished her kindled Tenderness: However, she told the
Sailor who related this Story, that from the Account he gave of this Man,
he must have been the same identical Person, with whom she had formerly
been acquainted, and if once she came to <i>England</i>, she would endeavour to
find out the Wife of this unfortunate Man, whom she knew very well, and
would acquaint her with this Catastrophe, and by so saying, concealed
herself entirely from the least Suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Having</span></span> now finished the Account of her Husbands untimely End, as related
to her at <i>Lisbon</i>; the Detail of which, appeared to her, as if sent from
above, to free her from those anxious Cares, which, in the midst of the
greatest Dangers, always set triumphant in her Breast, I shall now proceed
to her Voyage from thence to <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">They</span></span> set sail from <i>Lisbon</i> the 3d of <i>May</i>, and arrived at <i>Spithead</i> the
1st of <i>June</i>, without any Thing material during the Voyage (which was
lengthened by Calms and contrary Winds); that very Day she arrived at
<i>Spithead</i> she came on Shore, and took a Lodging along with several of her
Shipmates and Marines, at one <i>James Cunningham</i>&#8217;s, at the Sign of the
<i>Jolly Marine</i> and <i>Sailor</i>; where the House being thronged with Lodgers,
she was obliged to be Bedfellow to one <i>John Huchins</i>, a Brother Marine,
the first Night; but during her short Stay in <i>Portsmouth</i>, in her often
Rovings in and about the Town, (which was only two Days and three Nights)
she happen&#8217;d to meet with the Sister of Mr. <i>Cunningham</i>, the Drum-Major&#8217;s
Wife, one <i>Catherine &mdash;&mdash;</i>, with whom she had cultivated a slender
Acquaintance at the Time she first enlisted there. This young Woman knew
<i>Hannah</i> to be the young Soldier that had enlisted and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> sent abroad
with Admiral <i>Boscawen</i>, and expressed some Joy at her safe Return: Then
entering into this Conversation, introduced a farther Intimacy; and
<i>Hannah</i>, rather than sit to drink with her Shipmates, spent most of her
Time with this young Woman. This Opportunity improved their Conversation,
and sometimes they conversed upon Love; and <i>Hannah</i> finding this young
Woman had no dislike to her, she endeavoured to try if she could not act
the Lover as well as the Soldier, which she so well effected, that it was
agreed upon she should return from <i>London</i>, in order to be married as
soon as she had got her Discharge and Pay; and tho&#8217; but so short a Time
there as two Days, had effected this her Amour so as to obtain the young
Woman&#8217;s Consent to marry her.</p>

<p>In order to countenance this her Scheme, she told the supposed Object of
her Love, that as soon as she arrived at <i>London</i>, and received her Wages,
she would remit the same to her; and when she had visited, and tarried
some time with each of her nigh Relations and intimate Friends, she would
then return to <i>Portsmouth</i>, according to Agreement, and consummate their
matrimonial Ceremonies with a Solemnity suitable to her Abilities.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> next Night, being <i>Saturday</i> the 2d of <i>June</i>, <i>Hannah</i>&#8217;s Bedfellow,
who had lain with her the Night before, went out of Town, and one <i>James
Moody</i>, who had been a Ship-mate with her on board the <i>Eltham</i> from Fort
St. <i>David</i>&#8217;s to <i>England</i>, coming in the Evening of that Day, and wanting
a Lodging, he was received by the Landlord, and as <i>Hannah</i> was his
intimate, he was admitted to be her Bedfellow, which continued for two
Nights together, without the least Suspicion in Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">It</span></span> is here
worthy of Observation, that this Woman should lay three Nights
with two different Men, one of whom who had been her Companion and
Fellow-adventurer, during the Space of fifteen Months and more; and never,
during that Space of Time, discover the least Hint of her being of the
female Kind; and this Man had often been her Assistant in the most
dangerous Exploits, and could not avoid acknowledging, that she behaved
upon all Occasions, with the greatest Bravery and Resolution.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Whitmonday</span></span>, being the 4th of <i>June</i>, she set out from <i>Portsmouth</i> for
<i>London</i>; accompanied by <i>George Orley</i>, a Serjeant of Marines, who was a
Partner with her in her Adventures, and who, together with nine Marines,
accompanied her to <i>London</i>: She received before they set out from
<i>Portsmouth</i>, five Shillings Conduct-money. The first Place she traveled
to after her departure from <i>Portsmouth</i>, was <i>Petersfield</i>, in
<i>Hampshire</i>; where she lay all Night, with one <i>Andrew Gray</i> a Marine, not
only in the same Regiment, but in the same Company: Next Day travel&#8217;d as
far as <i>Guildford</i>, where the aforesaid <i>Andrew Gray</i> and she were
Bedfellows; next Night she arrived in <i>London</i>, where she disingaged
herself from her old Intimates, and lodged along with her Brother, Mr.
<i>James Gray</i>, Carpenter, in <i>Ship-Street, Wapping</i>; where she now resides.</p>

<p>Now I have brought my female Adventurer home again to her native Country,
after near five Years Adventures; prompted thereto by the ill Usage of a
faithless Husband, who, after first stripping her of her all, and then
eloping, prompted her to the Resolution of disguising herself, by putting
on Men&#8217;s Apparel, going into the Country without the Knowledge of her
Brother, Sister, or any other of her Friends, in search of him who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
thus abused her; and entering into Colonel <i>Guise</i>&#8217;s Regiment of Foot,
then lying at <i>Coventry</i>, who from thence marched to <i>Carlisle</i>, where she
was ill used, the Particulars of which, are set forth at large in the
foregoing Pages: How she received five hundred Lashes at <i>Carlisle</i>, as a
Punishment for her virtuous Conduct, her Resolution to desert, and her
puting this Determination into Execution; her changing her military
Cloathing about a Mile from Town, for the rustick Garb of a Shepherd; her
Arrival at <i>Portsmouth</i>, her entering into General <i>Fraser</i>&#8217;s Regiment of
Marines, her being draughted out for the <i>East Indies</i>; her embarking on
board the <i>Swallow</i> Sloop of War, under the Command of Admiral <i>Boscawen</i>,
and the many Vicissitudes she underwent during the Series of her
Adventures, until her safe (though unexpected) return to her Native
Country, where, after her Arrival, she met with sundry humorous Incidents;
with many other material Circumstances, the Particulars of which is here
set down at large; but not to swell this Treatise with any Thing
fictitious or doubtful, I have asserted nothing but plain Matter of Fact
as here set down.</p>

<p>I would have my candid Readers survey in Imagination, the many various
Scenes that here display themselves with a most surprizing Lustre. Here is
a Woman, and an <i>English</i> Woman, who, notwithstanding the many Dangers and
Vicissitudes she underwent for near the Space of five Years, during her
Travels, was never found out to be of the feminine Gender. It is true many
threatned Discoveries were attempted by her Shipmates and
Fellow-Adventurers, which derived its Influence from her not having a
Beard; but her ready Turns of Mind undeceived all those who shewed
themselves overbusy in prying into this Secret: This her Conduct, very
surprizingly preserved her Virtue from becoming a Sacrifice to the
Impetuosity of the carnal Desires of both her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> Superiors and Inferiors;
for can it be imagined, that in the midst of so many Dangers, where there
was no Back-Door to creep out at, if her Sex had been discovered, but she
must have fallen a Victim to the loose, disorderly, and vitious Appetites
of many on board, especially those whom she was more immediately concerned
with, to wit, her Officers. These Reflections must possess the Reader with
generous Sentiments of this our Heroine, who by her Subtilty, and ready
Inventions, destroyed in the Embrio, every Thing advanced by her
Fellow-Shipmates, that she imagined might be a Means of exposing her
Virtue.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Such</span></span> an Adventure as this, is not to be met with in the Records of either
antient or modern Observations, therefore, for the Sake of the <i>British</i>
Nation, ought to be recorded in Golden Characters on a Statue of Marble
for succeeding Ages, to peruse with Admiration, that an <i>English</i> Woman
should, <i>Amazon</i> like, not only enter herself upon the List in behalf of
her Country at Home, but boldly and resolutely launch out into the most
remote Corners of the Earth, upon enterprizing and dangerous Adventures,
the like never attempted before by any of her Sex, even daring Fate, as it
were, to execute her most rigorous Inflictions upon her; the many
Struglings and Conflicts she encounter&#8217;d during the Course of her Travels,
not being used to the watery Element, and the many Revolutions that often
happen upon the Surface of the Deep; the many Duties she was obliged to
execute, in the midst of Hundreds of the most unpolite Part of Mankind,
such as Tars; the many Fears and Suspicions she harboured least her Sex
should be discovered, to avoid which, she proved her own Physician, in
extracting the Ball out of her Wound, to prevent that Discovery which must
unavoidably have happened, had she permitted the Surgeons to have
performed their regular Operations: These, with many more, (seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
insurmountable Difficulties) did this our <i>British</i> Heroine undergo, and
overcome, by her safe Arrival in her native Country, as before-mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">When</span></span> she arrived in <i>London</i>, she went to her Brother in Law&#8217;s House, in
<i>Ship-Street, Wapping</i>; where he lived at the Time when she went abroad;
she no sooner entered the House, than her Sister (notwithstanding her
Disguise) knew her, but her Brother in Law, Mr. <i>Gray</i> being in Bed, she
went to his Bedside, being desirous to see him, where he lay in a Slumber,
and embraced him, upon which he awoke, and seeing a Person in a Soldier&#8217;s
Dress, coming to his Bedside in such a Manner and imbracing him, surprised
him much, however, he was soon freed from this Surprize by her discovering
herself, which afforded him a great deal of Satisfaction; as she was his
great Favourite before she went abroad, and her sudden and unexpected
Appearance, caused a great deal of Joy, in the whole Family; after
refreshing herself with a Part of what the House afforded, she diverted
her Brother and Sister &#8217;till Bed-time, with some Part of her Adventures,
which relation forced Tears from their Eyes.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">There</span></span> was at this Time a Female Lodger in Mr. <i>Gray</i>&#8217;s House, of whom Mr.
<i>Gray</i> requested, that she would admit a Sister of his for a Bedfellow, to
which she readily agreed: But when the Sister was introduced, the young
Woman, who was then in Bed, was very much surprized to see a Soldier sit
down to undress himself in her Bed-Chamber; but Mr. <i>Gray</i> and his Wife
discovered the Secret, which, notwithstanding, she would not Credit, until
she had occular Demonstration. This was the first, next to her Brother and
Sister, that she discovered herself to, and ever since they have been
Bedfellows, which made the Neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> report (imagining her to be a Man)
that the young Woman was married to a Soldier, and this great Untruth was
reported for Fact throughout the whole Neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Sometime</span></span> after this, she, in Company with her Sister and supposed Wife,
went to <i>Westminster</i>, in order to see her Friends, who were very much
dissatisfy&#8217;d at her carrying a strange Woman in Company with her supposed
Brother, who perhaps, upon receiving his Money, might decoy him into some
Place of bad Fame, where he might chance to lose it all in an Instant.
This, together with some former Passages, constrains me to observe how
much the Publick, both at Home and Abroad, have been deceived in this
Woman, she being so long in the Army and Navy, where there were many
penetrating clear-sighted Gentlemen, and ashore in foreign Countries
amongst Men, Women and Children; and notwithstanding all these publick
Characters, her Sex not discovered. This must cause Admiration in every
Reader; but she counterfeited the Man so dextrously, and does to this very
Day, that the most excellent Judge of Features, Semetry or Gesture, cannot
discover the Deceit.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">But</span></span> that I may not suffer any of my inquisitive Readers to remain in
suspence concerning some particular Adventures that befel her, the bare
Relation of which may not be altogether so satisfactory, I shall explain
those which appear most Paradoxical, in order not only to satisfy every
Reader, but also to prevent any future Reflexions that might occasionally
arise from such a Neglect.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">When</span></span> she first enter&#8217;d into the Service at <i>Coventry</i>, she marched to
<i>Carlisle</i>, where she was Whipt for Neglect of Duty, being unjustly
accused by Serjeant <i>Davis</i>, as is fully mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the preceding
Pages. The Method she used to prevent the Discovery of her Sex was this,
according to her own Declaration: Her Breasts were then not so big by much
as they are at present, her Arms being extended and fixed to the City
Gates, her Breasts were drawn up, and consequently did not appear so
large; and besides this, her Breast was to the Wall, and could not be
discovered by any of her Comrades; and when she was Whipt on board, her
Hands being lashed to the Gangway, she stood upright, and tied a
Handkerchief round her Neck, to prevent, as it were, any Lashes that she
might accidentally receive there, to conceal her Breasts, which were
covered by the Ends of the Handkerchief falling over them, and thereby
prevented a Discovery which must unavoidably have happened, had not she
thus acted. And what the Consequences of such an unravell&#8217;d Secret would
have produced, she was at a Loss to imagine, the Thoughts of which
perplexed her incessantly; however, she escaped being discovered at this
Juncture also, as well as at many more, when she imagined herself in the
most imminent Dangers: But all those adverse Turns gave an Edge to her
Inventions, and by that means extricated her out of the many Difficulties
she was involved in.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">This</span></span> the Reader may plainly perceive throughout the whole Narration; and I
am convinced, that no Age or Country, ever produced a more distinguished
Instance of Virtue, Conduct and Resolution, than is to be met with in this
our Heroine&#8217;s Adventures, which is worthy to be transmitted to latest
Posterity; to inform succeeding Ages, that such an Instance of Heroism was
not to be found in the <i>British</i> Annals, that the like could not be met
with, in the Observations of any Nation in the World, that a Woman, whose
mould is tender, delicate and unable to endure Fatigues, and who is
terrified at the Name of Dangers, should undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> so many Scenes without
relinquishing her Resolution of keeping her Sex a Secret.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I had</span></span> forgot to mention a Circumstance worthy of Notice, in its proper
Place, which happened at <i>Lisbon</i>, concerning the two Sweethearts, she and
<i>Edward Jefferies</i> had there, as is before mentioned; which was, that when
she and <i>Jefferies</i> were on board before they set sail from <i>Lisbon</i> to
<i>England</i>, these two young Women, of whom mention is made, came along the
Ship&#8217;s Side in a Boat, and called for <i>James Grey</i>, and she being informed
thereof, went into the Boat where they were, but after a little
Conversation, she found them inclined to come on board, and remain there
while they lay in the River; she promised to ask Leave of the Captain for
their Reception, but a fresh and seasonable Thought came into her Head,
which was, that if they came on board, and continued any Time, they might
sooner discover her than any of the Men, therefore to prevent the worst,
instead of pleading for their Admittance, she requested of the Captain,
that they should not be suffered to come on board. This Request was not
only intended for her own Preservation, but likewise to preserve the Women
from being debauched by the Sailors, which they could not have avoided,
had they came on board; by which Means, both she and they escaped the
threatned Danger.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I know</span></span> the Reader will be desirous to know how the Ball was extracted out
of her Groin, and will imagine, that it was next to an Impossibility it
could be performed without a Discovery. Now to rectify the Scruples of
such, I shall relate this Account as attested by herself; which she said
was, that after she received the twelve Wounds, as before mentioned, she
remained all that Day, and the following Night in the Camp, before she was
carried to the Hospital, and after she was brought there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> laid in a
Kit, she continued till next Day in the greatest Agony and Pain, the Ball
still remaining in the Flesh of that Wound in her Groin, and how to
extract it she knew not, for she had not discovered to the Surgeons that
she had any other Wound than those in her Legs. This Wound being so
extreme painful, it almost drove her to the Precipice of Despair; she
often thought of discovering herself, that by that Means she might be
freed from the unspeakable Pain she endured, by having the Ball taken out
by one of the Surgeons; but that Resolution was soon banished, and she
resolved to run all Risques, even at the hazard of her Life, rather than
that her Sex should be known. Confirmed in this Resolution, she
communicated her Design to a black Woman, who attended upon her, and could
get at the Surgeons Medicines, and desired her Assistance; and her Pain
being so very great, that she was unable to endure it much longer, she
intended to try an Experiment upon herself, which was, to endeavour to
extract the Ball out of that Wound; but notwithstanding she discovered her
Pain and Resolution to this Black, yet she did not let her know that she
was a Woman. The Black readily came, and afforded her all the Assistance
she could, by bringing her Lint and Salve to dress the Wound with, which
she had recourse to, it being left in the Wards where the Patients lay;
for which Act of Friendship she made her a Present of a Rupee at her
Departure, which is 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> of the Currency of that Country, but here
in <i>England</i> it goes for no more than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Now the Manner in which
she extracted the Ball was full hardy and desperate: She prob&#8217;d the Wound
with her Finger till she came where the Ball lay, and then upon feeling
it, thrust in both her Finger and Thumb, and pulled it out. This was a
very rough Way of proceeding with ones own Flesh; but of two Evils, as she
thought, this was the least, so rather chusing to have her Flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> tore and
mangled than her Sex discovered. After this Operation was performed, she
applied some of the healing Salves which the Black had brought her, by the
help of which she made a perfect Cure of that dangerous Wound.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> Reader will here observe, the invincible Courage and Resolution of
this Woman, who in the midst of so many Inconveniences as she daily
encounter&#8217;d, should still be able to guard herself from a discovery of her
Sex; but indeed it appears she acted so artfully on every Emergency, as
rendered any Attempts of this Kind abortive; for notwithstanding the Wound
she received in her Groin was the most dangerous of all the others, yet
that was the only Wound she kept from the Knowledge of the Surgeons, by
telling them, when they came to examine her, that all the Wounds she had
received were in her Legs which they readily believed; and by that Means
prevented any farther Search.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Observe</span></span> here the Steadiness and Intrepidity wherewith she overcame all the
Pains and Dangers which assaulted her. Who would not in the midst of so
much Agony and Pain as she felt here, broke through the strongest and most
virtuous Resolutions in order to obtain immediate Relief? But she remained
still inflexible in the midst of every Affliction wherewith she was
environed, no Consideration could ever prevail upon her in her own Mind to
deviate from the Resolutions she had imbibed upon her first Launching out,
and which, though it cost her many a painful Hour, yet by her steady
Adherence to these Principles, she obtained a Conquest over near five
Years adverse Fortune.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Now</span></span> having satisfied the Reader&#8217;s Doubts in Regard to the Methods she used
to conceal her Sex from the Knowledge of any about her, on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
particular Occasions, when she was most exposed, <i>viz.</i> the twice she was
whipt, and upon the dressing of her Wounds, which were Times I say, when
Danger was at the Door ready to burst in, and plunder the Habitation of
its most valuable Furniture; I shall next proceed, to shew the Reader some
Transactions that has occur&#8217;d since she came to <i>London</i>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Tho&#8217;</span></span> she had not discovered her Sex to any besides her Brother in Law, her
Sister, and the young Woman with whom she lodged; she was very uneasy,
fearing, lest a further Discovery should be made, and she thereby deprived
of her Soldier&#8217;s Pay. This Motive induced her to conceal herself as much
as possible, till she had received her Pay, (being 15 Pounds) which she
accordingly did on the <i>Saturday</i> after her Arrival in <i>London</i>, being the
9th Day of <i>June</i>, when she, with Serjeant <i>Orley</i>, <i>John Hutchins</i>,
<i>James Moody</i>, <i>Andrew Grey</i>, and the rest of the Marines that came to
<i>London</i> with her, went to the Agent <i>John Winter</i>, Esq; in
<i>Downing-Street, Westminster</i>; where being all paid and discharged, they
went to an Alehouse, the Fighting-Cocks, next Door to Mr. <i>Winter</i>&#8217;s
House, and there she first discovered herself to her Comrades. There being
two Suits of Cloathing due to her from the Regiment, she also sold them
for 16<i>s.</i> being glad to get hold of all the Money she could before her
Sex was discovered.</p>

<p>Now upon receiving her Pay, and all her fellow Adventures then present,
she thought that was the most proper Opportunity she ever could have, for
disclosing her Sex, seeing they could then testify the Truth of all the
Fatigues, Dangers and other Incidents of her Adventures, and that her Sex
was never discovered, which if then omitted, she might never have an
Opportunity of seeing them all together again, and by that Means, the
Account of her Adventures as aforesaid, might be lookt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> by the
Publick as fictitious: These Considerations prevailed upon her to embrace
the then seasonable Occasion, for discovering herself, before they took a
final Leave; she therefore proposed to them to make merry before they
parted, which was agreed to by one and all of them, as they expected never
to meet altogether any more; and then she discovered herself to the whole
Company which caused a universal Surprise amongst them all.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">But</span></span> after they had recovered themselves from this sudden Emotion, which
the aforesaid surprizing Information had thrown them into, they could
hardly be prevailed upon to believe the Truth of what she advanced, until
her Brother and Sister undeceived them, by informing them of the whole
Transaction. Upon which, they all with one Voice sounded forth her Praise,
by applauding her Courage as a Soldier, her Dexterity as a Sailor, her
humane Deportment and Sincerity as a Friend, having performed many good
Offices towards them in Times of their Sickness, and upon every other
Opportunity. They expatiated much upon the Evenness of her Temper, the
Regularity of her Conduct, and the many Dangers and Hardships she
underwent, without ever shewing the least sign of Discontent with her
Situation. These Encomiums once over, the forementioned <i>Moody</i>, who had
been her Bedfellow two Nights, and was present at this Discovery, became
of a sudden so much enamoured with her, that he proposed to marry her,
which she refused, upon reflecting what a bad Husband she formerly had,
and who had been the Instrument of all her Misfortunes, therefore for his
sake she resolved, in the Mind she was then in, never to engage with any
Man living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Now</span></span> upon
the Discovery of her Sex, her Relations, and some of her intimate
Friends, advised her to apply by a Petition to his Royal Highness the Duke
of <i>Cumberland</i>, not doubting but that his Highness would make some proper
Provision for her, as she had received so many Wounds. Upon which a
Petition was drawn up, setting forth her Adventures, and the Hardships she
underwent, together with the many Wounds she received, which she was the
Bearer of herself, and coming where his Royal Highness then was in his
Landau, accompanied by Colonel <i>Napier</i>, she delivered her Petition to his
Royal Highness, and upon his perusing it, gave it to the Colonel, desiring
him to enquire into the Merits. So that it is not doubted but his Royal
Highness will make her some handsome Allowance, exclusive of <i>Chelsea</i>
College, to which she is entitled.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Now</span></span>, notwithstanding this our Heroine has at sundry Times appeared upon a
publick Stage since her Return to <i>England</i>, and diverted the Auditors
with a Song or two, in order to procure a little Money, wherewith to
support her present necessary Expences, yet the Publick we hope will
encourage her, if she should have a Benefit Play perform&#8217;d on her own
Account, as an Encouragement for the many singular Adventures, and signal
Deliverances from the many Perils and Dangers that environed her, and all
in the Behalf of her Country: Her Merit I think is such as is sufficient
to set her upon a Level with the most celebrated Ladies of antient Times.
She is not to be put in the Lists with the fictitious and fabulous Stories
of a <i>Pamella</i>, &amp;c. no, her Virtues have displayed their Lustre in the
remotest Corner of the World, the once fam&#8217;d <i>Asia</i>. It was here she
performed such noble Deeds, as will cause her Name and Fame to be revered
to latest Posterity: Here is the real <i>Pamella</i> to be to found, who in the
midst of thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> of the Martial Gentry, preserved her Chastity by the
most virtuous Stratagems that could be devised: Next behold her upon the
Ocean, surrounded with Storms, Tempests and Hurricanes, every Moment
expecting the watery Element should prove her Tomb; and as an Addition to
her wretched Situation, she was intermixed with the hardy resolute Tars,
who soon would have batter&#8217;d down the Fort of her Virtue, had they
discovered that <i>James Gray</i> was Mrs. <i>Hannah Snell</i>. See her making for
fair <i>Asia</i>&#8217;s ancient Shore, with all the speed that Canvas Wings could
carry her; and going aloft and discharging the Duty of a skilful Mariner;
afterwards upon the Poop and Quarter Deck exercising her small Arms, as an
able and experienced Soldier: Then when the Enemy were attacked, firing
her Pontoons, brandishing her Sword, receiving dangerous Wounds, and
spilling her precious Blood: If these, together with many more
Circumstances, are not Virtues infinitely surpassing the Adventures and
Virtues of our romantick <i>Pamella</i>, I own I am mistaken, and shall leave
them to the Judgment of the impartial Reader. This is a real <i>Pamella</i>;
the other a counterfeit; this <i>Pamella</i> is real Flesh and Blood, the other
is no more than a Shadow: Thefore let this our Heroine, who is the Subject
of this History, be both admired and encouraged.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I shall</span></span> conclude this Subject, with observing, that notwithstanding the
many Reflections thrown upon the Fair Sex on Account of their Weakness in
Point of Secret, the Conduct of our Heroine in this Particular is a plain
and demonstrative Proof of this Truth, that a Woman is not only capable of
confining a Secret in her Bosom, but actually do so upon sundry
Emergences, seeing she concealed her Sex in the midst of the greatest
Dangers and Hardships; no Difficulties, no Pains, no Terrors, nor Prospect
of future Calamities, could prevail upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> her to discover a Secret, which,
if once divulged, might have proved more fatal to her Repose, than all the
Difficulties she had undergone during the past Course of her Adventures.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">The</span></span> Adventures of this Female Soldier, as the like is not to be
parallelled in History, should never be forgot by our <i>British</i> Ladies,
but whenever satirized by any of the Masculine Gentry, they should always
have this Repartee ready, <i>Remember</i> <span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">Hannah Snell</span></span>.</p>

<p><span class="gesp"><span class="smcap">I shall</span></span> now conclude with informing the Publick, that she still continues
to wear her Regimentals; but how she intends to dispose of herself, or
when, if ever, to change her Dress, is more than what she at present seems
certain of.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
